# Text-Based-Game
This is a secondary school (in French) final project I completed with a final grade of 95%.  

In this game, you create an account with a username and are able to play with a class and different statistics, diving into battles and trying to avoid death. This project was very enjoyble because I was able to create something playable and that can be enjoyed by others while also solving problems in a thick block of code and being able to pinpoint errors and resolve them. 

There is also a reflexion that will be attached that shows what I had planned in my head before creating it showing skills for plannification and completing the given tasks. 

This is a project done in a French school so there may be a language barrier.
