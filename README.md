# Text-Based-Game
This is a secondary school (in French) final project I completed with a final grade of 95%.  

In this game, you create an account with a username and are able to play with a class and different statistics, diving into battles and trying to avoid death. This project was very enjoyble because I was able to create something playable and that can be enjoyed by others while also solving problems in a thick block of code and being able to pinpoint errors and resolve them.
